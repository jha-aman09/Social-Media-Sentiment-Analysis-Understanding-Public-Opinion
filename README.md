# Social Media Sentiment Analysis 🌐

This repository contains a comprehensive project on sentiment analysis of Twitter data, utilizing Python for data processing, visualization, and sentiment classification. 

## Repository Overview 🔧
The repository includes the following files:

- **`Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for the sentiment analysis process, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment classification, and visualizations.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation and instructions for use.
- **`twitter_training.csv`**: Training dataset for sentiment analysis.
- **`twitter_validation.csv`**: Validation dataset for evaluating the sentiment model.

## Key Features 🔖
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, duplicate rows, and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Distribution of sentiments, entity analysis, and tweet message length analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful data visualizations.
4. **Sentiment Classification**: Using `TextBlob` to calculate polarity scores and categorize sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
5. **Highlighting Insights**: Identifying the most positive and negative tweets and analyzing sentiment by entity.
